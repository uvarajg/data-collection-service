# Data Collection Service - Context

## Current Goal
Build a reliable, self-improving data collection microservice for AlgoAlchemist.

## Service Status
- **Phase**: Initial Setup
- **State**: Repository created, structure defined
- **Ready**: No
- **Deployed**: No

## Dependencies
- **Parent System**: AlgoAlchemist trading platform
- **Data Sources**: Alpaca, Google Sheets, Yahoo Finance
- **Shared Data**: /workspaces/data folder
- **Communication**: REST API + Event Stream

## Current Focus
Setting up the foundational Python service with FastAPI.

## Next Steps
1. Install Python dependencies
2. Create basic FastAPI application
3. Implement health check endpoint
4. Add first data collector (Alpaca)
5. Set up Redis caching
6. Add metrics collection
7. Create Docker container

## Key Decisions Made
- Language: Python (for better data science libraries)
- Framework: FastAPI (async support)
- Cache: Redis (proven reliability)
- Deployment: Docker + Kubernetes

## Performance Targets
- Latency: < 200ms
- Success Rate: > 99%
- Cache Hit: > 80%
- Uptime: > 99.9%

## Remember
- This service must NEVER make trading decisions
- Always validate and normalize data
- Rate limits are critical - respect them
- Cache aggressively but intelligently
- Every failure should have a fallback
