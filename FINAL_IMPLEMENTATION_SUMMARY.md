## 🚀 Core Implementation

### 1. Main Collection Script: `collect_us_market_stocks.py`

**4-Step Process:**
```
Step 1: Download Raw Data (7,038 stocks from GitHub)
├── AMEX: 286 stocks
├── NASDAQ: 4,020 stocks
└── NYSE: 2,732 stocks

Step 2: Extract Fields (ticker, market_cap, country, industry, sector)

Step 3: Filter by Market Cap (>$2B)
├── Mega Cap (>$200B): 60 stocks
├── Large Cap ($10B-$200B): 880 stocks
└── Mid Cap ($2B-$10B): 1,137 stocks
Total: 2,077 stocks

Step 4: Enrich with YFinance (Parallel Processing)
├── ThreadPoolExecutor (50 concurrent)
├── Respectful rate limiting
├── Comprehensive stock data
└── Result: 2,075/2,077 successful (99.9%)
```

**Key Features:**
- **Zero API keys required** - uses public GitHub repositories and YFinance
- **Parallel processing** with ThreadPoolExecutor for 20x faster execution
- **Intermediate saves** every 10 batches for reliability
- **Clean file naming**: `raw_combined_*.json` and `enriched_yfinance_*.json`
- **Timestamped summaries**: `input_source_data_job_summary_*.json`

### 2. Intelligent File Management: `compress_old_files.py`

**Storage Strategy:**
```
Keep Forever (with compression after 7 days):
├── raw_combined_*.json → raw_combined_*.json.gz
└── enriched_yfinance_*.json → enriched_yfinance_*.json.gz

Auto-Delete After 7 days:
├── input_source_data_job_summary_*.json (7-day history)
├── failed_tickers_*.json (retry logs)
└── Legacy files (set_*.json, *.csv)
```

**Benefits:**
- **76% storage reduction** (JSON files compress to 10-20% of original size)
- **Forever retention** of essential data
- **Automatic cleanup** of temporary files
- **Transparent decompression** when loading data

### 3. GitHub Actions Automation: `.github/workflows/daily_stock_collection.yml`

**Daily Workflow (8 PM EST):**
```yaml
name: Daily Stock Data Collection
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 1 * * *'  # 8 PM EST (1 AM UTC next day)

Key Steps:
├── Install dependencies
├── Run data collection
├── Validate results (2,075+ stocks expected)
├── Upload artifacts (7-day retention)
├── Compress old files
└── Send email notifications (success/failure)
```

**Email Notifications:**
- **Success**: Stock count, file size, execution time
- **Failure**: Error details and workflow logs link
- **Monitoring**: GitHub repository stats and data quality metrics

### 4. File Naming Convention Update

**Eliminated Confusing Prefixes:**
```
Old Naming (Confusing):
├── set_a_raw_combined_*.json
├── set_b_extracted_*.json
├── set_c_filtered_2b_*.json
└── set_d_enriched_yfinance_*.json

New Naming (Clean):
├── raw_combined_*.json
└── enriched_yfinance_*.json
```

**Benefits:**
- **Cleaner file names** without confusing set_X prefixes
- **JSON only** (eliminated CSV duplicates)
- **Essential files only** (no intermediate saves)
- **76% storage savings** with compression strategy

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Data Collection Success
- **Raw Stock Download**: 7,038/7,038 stocks (100%)
- **Market Cap Filtering**: 2,077/7,038 stocks with >$2B market cap
- **YFinance Enrichment**: 2,075/2,077 stocks (99.9%)
- **Failed Tickers**: Only 2 stocks (BRK/A, BRK/B - special characters)

### Execution Performance
- **Total Execution Time**: ~3-4 minutes
- **Parallel Processing**: 50 concurrent YFinance requests
- **Rate Limiting**: Respectful, no API blocks
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient with intermediate saves

### Storage Efficiency
- **Raw Data**: ~8MB (`raw_combined_*.json`)
- **Enriched Data**: ~8MB (`enriched_yfinance_*.json`)
- **Total Per Day**: ~16MB
- **After Compression**: ~3-4MB (76% savings)
- **Monthly Storage**: ~580MB vs previous 2.4GB

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Data Sources
1. **GitHub Repositories** (Raw Data)
   - https://github.com/rreichel3/US-Stock-Symbols/
   - AMEX, NASDAQ, NYSE JSON endpoints
   - 7,038 stocks with market cap and sector data

2. **YFinance API** (Enrichment)
   - Comprehensive stock data
   - No API key required
   - Reliable public interface

### Processing Pipeline
```python
def main_pipeline():
    # Step 1: GitHub raw data download
    raw_data = download_from_github()

    # Step 2: Field extraction
    extracted = extract_fields(raw_data)

    # Step 3: Market cap filtering
    filtered = filter_by_market_cap(extracted, min_cap=2_000_000_000)

    # Step 4: YFinance enrichment (parallel)
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=50) as executor:
        enriched = parallel_yfinance_enrichment(filtered)

    # Step 5: Save results
    save_with_timestamp(enriched)
```

### GitHub Actions Integration
- **Scheduled execution** at 8 PM EST daily
- **Artifact uploads** with 7-day retention
- **Email notifications** for monitoring
- **Automatic compression** and cleanup
- **Zero manual intervention** required

## 🔧 Configuration & Setup
